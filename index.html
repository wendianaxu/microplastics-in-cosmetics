              <p><a href = "https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/microplastics">Microplastics</a> are tiny plastic particles less than 5 mm in length. Manufacturers add them into cosmetic products for various purposes. For example, tiny plastic beads in body wash helps with exfoliation. </p>
              <p>Microplastics in cosmetics eventually enter the rivers and oceans through the sewage system, and get ingested by aquatic animals from <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es400663f#">planktons</a> to <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-33334-5">whales</a>. They block the digestive tracts of aquatic organisms and bring harmful chemicals into their bodies. </p>
              <p>We are consuming microplastics too, for sure — microplastics have been found in a wide range of commercially harvested <a href = "https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP8936">seafood</a>. </p>
              <p>By the end of 2022, <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbead#Banning_production_and_sale_in_cosmetics">15 countries</a> have <strong>banned</strong> the manufacture and/or sale of plastic microbeads in rinse-off cosmetics. </p>
